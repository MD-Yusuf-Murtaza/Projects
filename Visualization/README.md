Suicides in India (2001–2012)
This repository contains an analysis of suicide trends in India from 2001 to 2012. Using a detailed dataset, the project explores various parameters such as age groups, gender, causes, professional profiles, and methods of suicide. The study provides actionable insights through data visualization, regional breakdowns, and predictive modeling.

Project Overview
Dataset Summary:

Time Period: 2001–2012.
Granularity: Yearly data across Indian states and Union Territories.
Parameters:
Causes of suicides.
Education status.
Means adopted.
Professional profiles.
Social and age demographics.
Objectives:

Identify trends and patterns in suicide cases based on age, gender, and other parameters.
Understand regional disparities in suicide causes and methods.
Predict future suicide trends using machine learning.
Steps and Methods
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Removed inconsistencies (e.g., irrelevant age groups like "0-100+").
Mapped age groups into categories (Child, Teen, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior).
Ensured a structured dataset for analysis.
Key Analyses:

Age-Based Trends: Teenagers (35.4%) and Adults (33.9%) showed the highest rates of suicides.
Gender Insights: Males were significantly more affected, though Teen and Adult females also contributed notably.
Causes: Family issues, illnesses, and marital problems emerged as the top contributors across age groups.
Professional Profiles: Farmers, daily wage earners, and housewives were the most vulnerable professions.
Means Adopted: Hanging, poisoning, and drowning were identified as the most common methods.
Regional Trends: States like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh had the highest suicide rates.
Predictive Modeling:

A Linear Regression model was developed to forecast suicide rates for the next five years.
Results showed a concerning upward trend, emphasizing the need for immediate interventions.
Visualizations
Age and Gender Distributions: Pie and bar charts.
Yearly Trends: Line plots showing the increase in suicide cases over time.
Regional Disparities: State-wise breakdowns of suicides by causes, means adopted, and professional profiles.
Top Causes & Professions: Detailed bar charts to highlight key findings.
Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
scikit-learn for building predictive models.
